--Why this is an embedded systems project--

This project implements a small embedded control loop on an Arduino Uno (ATmega328P).
The system reads an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04),
drives a micro-servo to sweep the sensor through an angular field of view,
computes distance from time-of-flight, and publishes angle–distance data over USB serial.

System elements
• Controller: Arduino Uno
• Sensor: HC-SR04 (Trig, Echo)
• Actuator: SG90-class micro-servo
• Interface: USB serial telemetry to a host computer

Data flow: sensor → microcontroller (measurement) → computation → servo motion → serial output

--How it works--
1.Trigger a short pulse on the sensor and measure the echo pulse width in microseconds.
2.Convert time-of-flight to distance in centimeters (divide by two for out-and-back travel).
3.Sweep the servo from 0° to 180° and back, sampling at each step.
4.Stream angle and distance readings over serial for logging or visualization.

--What this demonstrates--
• GPIO and timing for external sensors (Trig/Echo)
• PWM control for a hobby servo (approximately 1–2 ms pulse every 20 ms)
• UART/serial communication for telemetry
• Basic hardware integration: 5 V logic, common ground, handling servo current spikes (use a separate 5 V rail if needed)
